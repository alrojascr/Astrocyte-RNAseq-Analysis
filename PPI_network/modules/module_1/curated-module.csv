Following type I IFN (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) binding to cell surface receptors, signaling via protein kinases leads to activation of Jak kinases (TYK2 and JAK1) and to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STATs dimerize and associate with ISGF3G/IRF-9 to form a complex termed ISGF3 transcription factor, that enters the nucleus. ISGF3 binds to the IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) to activate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which drive the cell in an antiviral state. In response to type II IFN (IFN-gamma), STAT1 is tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated. It then forms a homodimer termed IFN-gamma-activated factor (GAF), migrates into the nucleus and binds to the IFN gamma activated sequence (GAS) to drive the expression of the target genes, inducing a cellular antiviral state. Becomes activated in response to KITLG/SCF and KIT signaling. May mediate cellular responses to activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4.	Clustered	23

In addition, it may also play a role in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and gene regulation. Synthesizes higher oligomers of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP which then bind to the inactive monomeric form of ribonuclease L (RNase L) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation. Activation of RNase L leads to degradation of cellular as well as viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus terminating viral replication. Can mediate the antiviral effect via the classical RNase L-dependent pathway or an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L. The secreted form displays antiviral effect against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and stimulates the alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L.

Enhances MAVS- mediated host antiviral responses by serving as an adapter bridging TBK1 to MAVS which leads to the activation of TBK1 and phosphorylation of IRF3 and phosphorylated IRF3 translocates into nucleus to promote antiviral gene transcription. Exihibits an antiproliferative activity via the up-regulation of cell cycle negative regulators CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27. Normally, CDKN1B/p27 turnover is regulated by COPS5, which binds CDKN1B/p27 in the nucleus and exports it to the cytoplasm for ubiquitin- dependent degradation. IFIT3 sequesters COPS5 in the cytoplasm, thereby increasing nuclear CDKN1B/p27 protein levels. Upregulates CDKN1A/p21 by downregulating MYC, a repressor of CDKN1A/p21. Can negatively regulate the apoptotic effects of IFIT2.	Clustered	22.9233333333333

Acts as a major component of interferon gamma-induced sensitivity. Plays a key role in apoptosis via the degradation of the apoptotic inhibitor MCL1. May be involved in the inflammatory response pathway. In cancer cells, substitution of isoform 1 (E2) by isoform 2 (E1) results in immunoproteasome deficiency. Required for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes; Belongs to the peptidase T1B family.	Clustered	22.9233333333333

Can inhibit: influenza virus hemagglutinin protein-mediated viral entry, MARV and EBOV GP1,2- mediated viral entry, SARS-CoV S protein-mediated viral entry and VSV G protein-mediated viral entry. Plays a critical role in the structural stability and function of vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase).

Acts as a direct physical tether, holding virions to the cell membrane and linking virions to each other. The tethered virions can be internalized by endocytosis and subsequently degraded or they can remain on the cell surface. In either case, their spread as cell-free virions is restricted. Its target viruses belong to diverse families, including retroviridae: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), prototype foamy virus (PFV), Mason- Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV), flavivirideae: hepatitis C virus (HCV), filoviridae: ebola virus (EBOV) and marburg virus (MARV), arenaviridae: lassa virus (LASV) and machupo virus (MACV), herpesviridae: kaposis sarcoma- associated herpesvirus (KSHV), rhabdoviridae: vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), orthomyxoviridae: influenza A virus, and paramyxoviridae: nipah virus. Can inhibit cell surface proteolytic activity of MMP14 causing decreased activation of MMP15 which results in inhibition of cell growth and migration. Can stimulate signaling by LILRA4/ILT7 and consequently provide negative feedback to the production of IFN by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in response to viral infection. Plays a role in the organization of the subapical actin cytoskeleton in polarized epithelial cells. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 are both effective viral restriction factors but have differing antiviral and signaling activities. Isoform 2 is resistant to HIV-1 Vpu-mediated degradation and restricts HIV-1 viral budding in the presence of Vpu. Isoform 1 acts as an activator of NF-kappa-B and this activity is inhibited by isoform 2; CD molecules	Clustered	22.9233333333333

In addition, it may also play a role in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and gene regulation. Synthesizes higher oligomers of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP which then bind to the inactive monomeric form of ribonuclease L (RNase L) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation. Activation of RNase L leads to degradation of cellular as well as viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus terminating viral replication. Can mediate the antiviral effect via the classical RNase L-dependent pathway or an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L.	Clustered	22.9233333333333

This may affect gene expression and function in a number of ways that include mRNA translation by changing codons and hence the amino acid sequence of proteins; pre-mRNA splicing by altering splice site recognition sequences; RNA stability by changing sequences involved in nuclease recognition; genetic stability in the case of RNA virus genomes by changing sequences during viral RNA replication; and RNA structure-dependent activities such as microRNA production or targeting or protein-RNA interactions. Can edit both viral and cellular RNAs and can edit RNAs at multiple sites (hyper-editing) or at specific sites (site-specific editing). Its cellular RNA substrates include: bladder cancer- associated protein (BLCAP), neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate (GRIA2) and serotonin (HTR2C) and GABA receptor (GABRA3). Site-specific RNA editing of transcripts encoding these proteins results in amino acid substitutions which consequently alters their functional activities. Exhibits low-level editing at the GRIA2 Q/R site, but edits efficiently at the R/G site and HOTSPOT1. Its viral RNA substrates include: hepatitis C virus (HCV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus (MV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Exhibits either a proviral (HDV, MV, VSV and HIV-1) or an antiviral effect (HCV) and this can be editing-dependent (HDV and HCV), editing-independent (VSV and MV) or both (HIV-1). Impairs HCV replication via RNA editing at multiple sites. Enhances the replication of MV, VSV and HIV-1 through an editing- independent mechanism via suppression of EIF2AK2/PKR activation and function. Stimulates both the release and infectivity of HIV-1 viral particles by an editing-dependent mechanism where it associates with viral RNAs and edits adenosines in the 5'UTR and the Rev and Tat coding sequence. Can enhance viral replication of HDV via A-to-I editing at a site designated as amber/W, thereby changing an UAG amber stop codon to an UIG tryptophan (W) codon that permits synthesis of the large delta antigen (L-HDAg) which has a key role in the assembly of viral particles. However, high levels of ADAR1 inhibit HDV replication.	Clustered	22.9233333333333
